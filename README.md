 Classification-Feature-Engineering-Deployment
------------------------------------------------

Down syndrome in mice, wine quality datasets were tested using Random forest, SVM with RBF kernel
Examined feature importance and eliminated redundant features using RFECV to improve model accuracy
The wine quality predicted with Neural network model is deployed on a local web server using streamlit app

The detailed report and code is available in the folder attched
